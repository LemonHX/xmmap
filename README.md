# XMMAP

let me announcing the smallest feature-rich industrial-ready no-std cross-platform memory mapping api for rust!

## [**If you are windows user and you want to use large page, please read**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/lock-pages-in-memory)


## Motivation

`memmap` is dead!

and the API of memmap is not very user friendly.
